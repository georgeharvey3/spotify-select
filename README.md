spotify-select is a simple program that allows easy adding of albums into Spotify playlists using keyboard shortcuts.

First the album name is copied to the clipboard, then the script is triggered with a pre-determined keyboard shortcut, searching Spotify and adding an album with a matching name to a playlist of choice.
